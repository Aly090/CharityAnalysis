# CharityAnalysis
The Charity Analysis code offers a comprehensive dive into the world of philanthropy, shedding light on donor behaviors and patterns. Through this analytical journey, the code investigates various facets, including detailed profiles of donors and the corresponding donation amounts. Key variables, namely DAMT (Donation Amount) and DONR (Donor Characteristics), serve as the focal points of the analysis. Employing a range of predictive models, both DAMT and DONR variables were rigorously tested to uncover insights and predict future donation trends. Moreover, visual representations were crafted, plotting donations against donor profiles, enabling a clearer understanding of who the major benefactors are and how their contributions compare. This analysis is instrumental for charities looking to refine their fundraising strategies and build stronger relationships with their donor base.
